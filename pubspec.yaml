  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/emote/
    - assets/images/npc/
    - assets/images/enemy/
    - assets/images/enemy/goblin/
    - assets/images/enemy/imp/
    - assets/images/enemy/mini_boss/
    - assets/images/enemy/boss/
    - assets/images/player/
    - assets/images/items/
    - assets/images/tiled/
    - assets/audio/
    - resources/lang/en.json
    - resources/lang/pt.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Normal
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/font_pixel.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
